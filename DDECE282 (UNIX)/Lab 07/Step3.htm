<h1>Compiling the Program</h1>
First open Putty. Enter the server that the program is on. Putty will pop up and you will get this screen: <br>
<img border="0" src="./Step3_files/Host.jpg" alt="Host" width="467" height="450" <br="">
<p>Enter the server under "host name" and the port number (probably 22) then click open. You will then see this screen:</p>
<img border="0" src="./Step3_files/Login.jpg" alt="Login" width="667" height="425" <br="">
<p>From here, enter your username and password to login. Change your directory to whatever directory your program is in. Now
it is time to compile your program. Compile it by typing javac "Program Name", but replace "Program Name" with the name
of your program, including the .java extension. Then press enter. It should look like this:</p>
<img border="0" src="./Step3_files/Compile.jpg" alt="Login" width="672" height="424" <br="">
<p>If your program has any errors, Putty will state so now. It will state the line that the errors are on. If your program has
errors, go back and fix them. If not, proceed to the next step.</p>
