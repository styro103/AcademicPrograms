<h1>Running the Program</h1>
<p>Before you continue with this, follow the table below:</p><p>
</p><table border="1">
 <tbody><tr>
 <td></td>
 <td>No</td>
 <td>Yes</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Errors</td>
 <td>Continue</td>
 <td>Go Back and Fix Them</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody></table> 
<p>Afterwards, you are ready to run the program. Running it is really simple. Just type java "Program Name", but this time the
.java extension isn't needed. It should look like this:
<img border="0" src="./Step4_files/Run.jpg" alt="Run" width="676" height="425" <br="">
</p><p>Then press enter. If everything was done correctly, it should look like this:</p>
<img border="0" src="./Step4_files/Ran.jpg" alt="Ran" width="673" height="425" <br="">
<p>After this, your program is finished. Good job, you have created a basic program, but the power of JAVA far exceeds this.
