<h1>Coding the Program</h1>
<p>Before you continue with this, make sure you have the necessary materials listed before:</p><p>
</p><table border="1">
 <tbody><tr>
 <td>Program To</td>
 <td>No</td>
 <td>Yes</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Compile</td>
 <td>Get One</td>
 <td>Continue</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
 <td>Run</td>
 <td>Get One</td>
 <td>Continue</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
 <td>Write Code</td>
 <td>Get One</td>
 <td>Continue</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody></table> 
<br>
If so, then it's time to write the program. <br>
<p>Open a new Notepad++ file. The first thing you'll need to do is import the libraries. For this program you'll need to
import the java.io library. Do this by starting you program with the line "import java.io.*;". This is the only library
you'll need for this program.</p>
<p>The next thing you'll need to do is tell the create a class. This class will be the main class of your program.
This class can be named anything, but it must match whatever you will name this file when you save it. Afterwards,
but the left bracket symbol "{" on the next line, and the right bracket symbol "}" on the following line.</p>
<p>Now you will need to create a the programs main function. Do this by typing the line "public static void main(String [] args)".
This must be typed on a line between the brackets. Afterwards, you will need to put left and right brackets under this function 
as well</p>
<p>On a line between these brackets, type the following, "System.out.println("Hello World!");". "System.out.println()" 
tells it to print out a message in a line, and the quotation marks tells it to print whatever is in between them. This message 
can be changed to anything. To include your name, a random message, or anything else. All you have to do is change what is in 
between the quotation marks that are in the parenthesis. Make sure afterwards, you end this line with a semicolon. This tells
program to stop reading this line and go to the next one for the next command.</p>
<p>Afterwards, your program should be done. Save this program (remember to use the name that you named your class) with a
.java extension and into the folder of the server that you will be running this on. Then proceed to the next step.</p>
